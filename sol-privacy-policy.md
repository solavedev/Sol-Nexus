Effective: December 21, 2024

Thank you for using Stella, a Discord bot developed by the **Luminova Team**. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy outlines how Stella handles your data.

---

## 1. Data Handling and Storage

- **No Data Retention**: Stella does not store or retain any user input or interactions. All data processed by Stella is ephemeral and exists only for the duration of fulfilling your command.

- **Local Hosting**: Stella is hosted on a private system managed by the **Luminova Team**.

Data shared with these services is not permanently stored by Stella or the **Luminova Team**.  




## 2. User Responsibilities

- Avoid sharing sensitive or private information with Stella, as interactions are processed in real-time and may involve external services.
- Ensure compliance with Discord's [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) and any other relevant policies.


## 3. Security

- Stella relies on secure platforms, including Discord's API and Ollama's systems, to process commands. While we strive to maintain privacy and security, no system is immune to vulnerabilities. Use Stella responsibly.
