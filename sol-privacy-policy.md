Effective: December 21, 2024

Thank you for using Sol, a Discord bot developed by the **Luminova Team**. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy outlines how Sol handles your data.

## 1. Data Handling and Storage

- **No Data Retention**: Sol does not store or retain any user input or interactions. All data processed by Sol is ephemeral and exists only for the duration of fulfilling your command.

- **Local Hosting**: Sol is hosted on a private system managed by the **Luminova Team**.

## 2. User Responsibilities

- Avoid sharing sensitive or private information with Sol, as interactions are processed in real-time and may involve external services.
- Ensure compliance with Discord's [Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) and any other relevant policies.


## 3. Security

- Sol relies on secure platforms, including Discord's API and Ollama's systems, to process commands. While we strive to maintain privacy and security, no system is immune to vulnerabilities. Use Sol responsibly.
