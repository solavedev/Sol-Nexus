# Sol's Terms of Service
Effective: November 29, 2024

Thank you for choosing Sol, a Discord bot developed by the **Luminova Team**. 
Sol is designed to inspire creativity, facilitate meaningful connections, and provide engaging functionality for Discord users. By using Sol, you agree to the following terms, crafted to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By interacting with or using Sol, a Discord-based AI-powered application developed by the **Luminova Team**, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, you may not access or use the application.

This agreement incorporates, by reference, the following terms and policies that apply based on the services and tools Sol interacts with:
- [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)
- [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)
- [Meta's LLaMA License](https://ollama.com/library/llama2/blobs/7c23fb36d801)
- [Ollama License](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/LICENSE)

Your use of Sol also affirms that you comply with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction and that you will use the application responsibly, ethically, and with respect for others.

In using Sol, you represent that:
- You are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction or have obtained parental or guardian consent to use the application.
- You will not use Sol for malicious, illegal, or harmful activities, including but not limited to harassment, discrimination, or violating intellectual property rights.
- You understand that Sol leverages external tools, including Discord's services and LLaMA-based models, and that their respective terms and policies also apply.

## 2. Your Responsibilities
To ensure Sol fosters a respectful and creative environment, users agree to the following responsibilities:

**Use Sol Responsibly**  
Sol is a tool for creativity, productivity, and community building. Users must not exploit, spam, or misuse its features in ways that harm others or disrupt servers.

**Respect Others**  
Users must adhere to Discord's Community Guidelines and refrain from engaging in harassment, discrimination, or harmful behavior through Sol.

**Understand Local Hosting**  
Sol is hosted locally by the Luminova Team. While inputs are temporarily processed to fulfill commands, data is not stored or monitored directly. Users should be mindful of this setup and avoid sharing sensitive or private information.

**Comply with Relevant Policies**  
By using Sol, users agree to the terms and guidelines of all services involved, including:
- [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)
- [Meta's LLaMA License](https://ollama.com/library/llama2/blobs/7c23fb36d801)
- [Ollama License](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/LICENSE)

Failure to adhere to these responsibilities may result in the restriction or removal of access to Sol.

## 3. Privacy and Data

Sol respects your privacy and is designed to handle user data responsibly. Here's how your data is processed:

**Discord Integration**  
Sol operates through Discord's API to process user commands and interactions. Data exchanged during use is governed by Discord's Privacy Policy.

**Local Hosting**  
Sol is hosted locally by the Luminova Team on a private computer system. While input data is temporarily processed to enable functionality, it is not stored or retained. Due to the volume of interactions, monitoring user input is impractical and not part of regular operations.

**LLaMA and Ollama AI**  
Sol uses LLaMA AI, accessed through Ollama, to provide conversational capabilities. Inputs sent to LLaMA are processed in real-time but not permanently stored by Sol, LLaMA, or Ollama. These interactions are subject to Meta's LLaMA License and Ollama's Terms.

**Data Retention**  
Sol does not save or log user inputs after they are processed. All interactions are ephemeral and exist only to fulfill the requested functionality.

**Security**  
While Sol relies on secure systems like Discord's API and Ollama's infrastructure, users should avoid sharing sensitive or private information through the bot. Local hosting adds an additional layer of privacy by limiting exposure to external servers.
